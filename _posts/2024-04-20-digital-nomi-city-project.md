In the university-government-industry collaboration project "Digital Nomi City 2023," I worked with three companies, including **KOEI**, where I served as the lead researcher.  

I conducted **semi-structured interviews with 20 employees**, each lasting 30 minutes, to explore the impact of DX (Digital Transformation) on **employee well-being** in a highly digitized sheet metal manufacturing firm recognized in Japan's *Top 100 Aggressive IT SMEs*.

This project included:
- A final **presentation to the mayor** of Nomi City
- Receiving the **Excellent Presentation Award** at JAIST
- Cross-disciplinary collaboration and coordination

Here are some highlights:

ðŸ“Œ *This project offered me a meaningful chance to engage in real-world application of management science. I look forward to continuing such collaborative research that bridges theory, policy, and industrial practice.*
