Welcome to my academic homepage.  
I am a doctoral student at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), currently focusing on sustainable transformation in manufacturing industries.

My research explores how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can transition toward circular economy models, with particular attention to organizational culture, capabilities, and servitization. I am also interested in knowledge management practices that support long-term change.

This site provides an overview of my background, academic activities, and teaching experience.
