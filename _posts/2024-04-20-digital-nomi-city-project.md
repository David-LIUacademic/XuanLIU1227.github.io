In the university-government-industry collaboration project **"Digital Nomi City 2023"**, I worked with three companies, including **KOEI Corporation**, where I served as the lead researcher.

I conducted **semi-structured interviews with 20 full-time employees**, each lasting approximately 30 minutes, to explore how **digital transformation (DX)** impacts employees’ **motivation, work-life balance, and well-being** in a highly digitized sheet metal SME recognized in Japan’s *Top 100 Aggressive IT SMEs*.

**Qualitative results** showed both encouragement and stress associated with performance visualization.

Notably, female administrative staff actively embraced IT tools for self-growth and productivity.
