I am honored to have received the **Best Theme Paper Award** at the **International Conference on Service Science and Innovation (ICSSI 2024)**, held in Taiwan.

Our research, titled *"Interplay Between Servitization and the Circular Economy in Chinese Manufacturing SMEs: Analysis of Two Cases"*, was selected from among many international contributions. I presented our findings during the oral session, and the audience showed great interest in our integrated perspective on sustainability-oriented organizational transformation.
