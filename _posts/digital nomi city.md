As part of the **Digital Nomi City 2023** project, I had the opportunity to engage in an industry-academia-government collaboration to explore the intersection of **digital transformation (DX)** and **employee well-being (WB)** in manufacturing SMEs.

I served as the lead researcher for the case study of **KOEI Corporation**, a highly digitalized sheet metal processing SME recognized in Japanâ€™s *100 Promising IT-Driven SMEs* list. This company has implemented advanced IT systems such as KPCS and LINE WORKS.

### Fieldwork Overview

Between December 2023 and March 2024, I conducted **semi-structured interviews with all 20 full-time employees**, each lasting approximately 30 minutes. The aim was to understand how digital tools impact employees' working experience, motivation, and well-being.

### Key Topics Explored

- Visualization of operations and its motivational effect
- Communication efficiency improvements via LINE WORKS
- Work-life balance and autonomy in task planning
- Perceived pressure vs. empowerment from performance data

### Insights from Data Analysis

**Quantitative results** showed a clear link between digitalization and improvements in motivation, work efficiency, and WLB, particularly among manufacturing staff.  
**Qualitative analysis** revealed both positive and negative effects of performance data visualizationâ€”while some felt motivated, others experienced stress.

Interestingly, female administrative staff were more proactive in developing IT skills and leveraging digital tools for self-growth and daily task efficiency.

> ðŸ§  DX not only increases productivity but also plays a crucial role in shaping **employeesâ€™ emotional and psychological well-being**.

### Toward Better Practice

We proposed:
1. **Improving mentoring systems** and framing performance metrics as tools for growth rather than competition
2. **Creating safe spaces for employee feedback**, such as regular suggestion sessions
3. **Enhancing onboarding processes** to help new employees embrace DX positively

### Awards and Public Impact

This work was awarded the **Excellent Presentation Award** in JAISTâ€™s internal group presentation.  
Additionally, the results were formally reported to the **Mayor of Nomi City**, showcasing how research can contribute directly to local policy and business innovation.
